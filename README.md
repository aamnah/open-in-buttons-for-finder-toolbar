Works on macOS Mojave.

![screenshot](src/images/screenshot.png "screenshot")

## Available apps

- Terminal
- iTerm
- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime text

## How to
- Download apps
- Copy to Applications folder
- and drag it to Finder toolbar (hold `âŒ˜cmd`)

## Sublime Text
Run the following command to add a command line shortcut for Sublime Text. This is needed for the Finder button to work.

```bash
# Sublime Text 2
# ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublime

# Sublime Text 3
ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl
```

## Visual Studio Code
Run the following command in Visual Studio Code (`Cmd + Shift + P`)

```
>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH
```

## iTerm

Give the required Permissions

_System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility (Options on left hand side) > (Enter system password) Automation > Open-in-iTerm.app_


## Terminal

Give the required permissions

_System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility (Options on left hand side) > (Enter system password) Automation > Open-in-Terminal.app_

## To Do
- It should open the current folder if no file/folder is selected. Right now it does not open the current folder when buttons (Sublime Text, VS Code) are clicked without selecting a file/folder. For iTerm and Terminal, it opens the current folder by default, even if you have selected some folder inside the current folder and want that to open instead.
